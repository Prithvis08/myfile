    <h1>Docker (Software)</h1>
    <p>Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.</p>

    <p>The Docker software as a service offering consists of three components</p>

    <ul> <!-- changed to list in the tutorial -->
      <li>Software</li>
      <li>Objects</li>
      <li>Registries</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Docker can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux, Windows, or macOS computer. This enables the application to run in a variety of locations, such as on-premises, in a public cloud, and in a private cloud. When running on Linux, Docker uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel (such as cgroups and kernel namespaces) and a union-capable file system (such as OverlayFS) to allow containers to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines. Docker on macOS uses a Linux virtual machine to run the containers.</p>
