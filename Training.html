    <h1>Devops Training Feedback  </h1>
    <p>I feel better equipped to manage after completing the course. This was my objective at the beginning.The workshop is practical and informative. Intensive, but well paced. Mayank is enthusiastic and really aware of what he is explaining. Interesting, well managed and close to real word and life experiences. So till now my overall experience about the devops training is amazing.</p>
